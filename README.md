The Artificial Learning Environment Xperiment

This is a project with one goal - to make an Artificial Intelligence. This is no easy task and will probably not succeed. How does the AI interact with it's sensors and actuators? How does it remember things? What does it mean to be cognitive?  One of the main sources of this work will be based on the book "[Artificial Cognitive Architectures](http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781461480716)" by James A. Crowder, John N. Carbone and Shelli A. Friess.
